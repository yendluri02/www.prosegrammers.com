## Why Documentation Matters
 - Docs help others use your tool and support collaboration.
 - Good docs increase adoption and ease maintenance.
 - Goal: Evaluate Ruff's documentation using multiple frameworks.

## README-Driven Documentation 
 - README is the project's front door.
 - Key elements: purpose, setup, usage, contribution guidelines.
 - Writing README first aligns project goals with implementation.

## Diátaxis Framework
 - Organizes documentation by user needs: tutorials, how-to guides, references, explanations.
 - Functional quality: accuracy and usefulness.
 - Deep quality: flow and user anticipation.

## Strengths
 - README-driven: 'Getting started' is clear and approachable.
 - Diátaxis: Tutorials/how-to for new users are well-covered.
 - Narrative & Global: Core usage and value communicated clearly.

## Weaknesses & Opportunities
 - README-driven: Limited 'why' explanations behind rules/config.
 - Diátaxis: Heavy on reference, fewer advanced explanations.
 - Narrative & Global: No multilingual versions, examples assume typical developer environments.
