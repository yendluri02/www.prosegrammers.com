## Ruff Overview
Ruff is a program made for linting and code formatting for Python files. Linting checks your code for errors and bugs but also for style issues - for example, sorting imports or getting rid of excessive empty lines. With formatting, ruff checks for formatting styles such as how many spaces for an indent or the max length of a line. The command `ruff check` will tell you of any linting issues it finds as well as the specific code it would give to that type of issue. `ruff check --fix` will fix said issues. To format your files run `ruff format`.

## Why Documentation Matters
 - Docs help others use your tool and support collaboration.
 - Good docs increase adoption and ease maintenance.
 - Goal: Evaluate Ruff's documentation using multiple frameworks.

## README-Driven Documentation
 - README is the project's front door.
 - Key elements: purpose, setup, usage, contribution guidelines.
 - Writing README first aligns project goals with implementation.

## Diátaxis Framework
 - Organizes documentation by user needs: tutorials, how-to guides, references, explanations.
 - Functional quality: accuracy and usefulness.
 - Deep quality: flow and user anticipation.

## Strengths
 - README-driven: 'Getting started' is clear and approachable.
 - Diátaxis: Tutorials/how-to for new users are well-covered.
 - Narrative & Global: Core usage and value communicated clearly.

## Weaknesses & Opportunities
 - README-driven: Limited 'why' explanations behind rules/config.
 - Diátaxis: Heavy on reference, fewer advanced explanations.
 - Narrative & Global: No multilingual versions, examples assume typical developer environments.

## Ruff: Literate Programming
As stated in the DECO presentation, Literate Programming explains why and how code works and prioritizes human legibility. Though it doesn’t do the former, it can aid in providing the latter. For example, with Ruff, if you have multiple parameters in a function header, when you run `ruff format` on the file, it will organize the parameters to have one on each line. This makes it much easier to read, even though it takes more lines, following Literate Programming’s ideal of “clarity over preciseness.” The Ruff documentation itself also uses comments to provide notes on its code examples, such as comments for the commands `ruff check` and `ruff format`.

## Ruff: Localization
As for Localization, Ruff is made for linting and formatting which doesn’t have so much to do with this process. According to the DECO presentation, it is the process of adapting content/software/documentation to a specific locale. Ruff can’t really help with translations or dates/times, but it can keep your code linted and formatted which makes your code easier to read when you are working on localization.
