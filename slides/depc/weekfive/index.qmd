# Quarto Overview
Quarto is a publishing tool that allows you to combine code and other content into formats such as PDF, Word Documents, HTML, and presentations, such as this current presentation.
The documentation offers tutorials for getting started as well as reference guides for some of the content it can include.

# "Hello, Quarto" Tutorial
After the “Getting Started” section, which simply provides the downloads for Quarto on separate platforms, there are three tutorials that the Quarto documentation provides, “Hello, Quarto” being the first of them. It provides this tutorial for multiple tools, including VS Code and RStudio. It tells you how to render and preview Quarto documents, shows you an example of a `.qmd` file, talks about making changes and explains how Quarto works as a combination of Markdown and code blocks.

# "Markdown Basics" Reference Guide
The first of many guides offered in the Quarto documentation, this shows the syntax and output of many elements in Markdown such as text formatting, headings, links, lists, and tables. The difference between this and "Hello, Quarto" is the tutorial is geared towards the user and the content is read in order, the user learning as they go, whereas the reference just explains the syntax for a group of elements that the user can pick and choose which ones to use.
